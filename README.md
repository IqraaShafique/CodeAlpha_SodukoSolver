#CodeAlpha_SodukoSolver
This C++ program is a console-based Sudoku puzzle solver that enhances the user experience with colored text using ANSI escape codes. The main functionality is encapsulated in a SodukoSolver struct, which includes methods for user input, grid display, validation, and solving the puzzle using the backtracking algorithm.

The SodukoSolver struct contains several methods: 
-> getInput collects the Sudoku puzzle from the user,
-> printGrid displays the current state of the grid with clear formatting, 
-> isSafe checks if a number can be placed in a specific cell without violating Sudoku rules,
-> solveSudoku uses backtracking to solve the puzzle.

In the main function, an instance of SodukoSolver is created, and a 9x9 grid is initialized. The program prompts the user to enter the Sudoku puzzle and then displays the unsolved grid. It attempts to solve the puzzle and, if successful, prints the solved grid. If no solution exists, it informs the user.
